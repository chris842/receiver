# SDR Project
Software-defined radio receiver Engineering Electronics ii, Spring 2020
Partners: Chrisner Garcesa and Andrew Nascimento

## Goal
The goal of this project was to design the schematic for a radio receiver and implement it on a PCB.

## Specifications
The specific goals to achieve given by our professor were as follows:  
	Minimum discernible signal of less than 1uV  
	Image rejection of over 48kHz of band greater than 30dB  
	Tunable range of frequencies greater than 48kHz  
	Band frequency greater than 540kHz  
	Spurious signals below 10uV  

Additional equipment we would have at our disposal would be the Arduino Nano Every
